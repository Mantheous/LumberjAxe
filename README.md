# LumberjAxe
This is the unity file for the LumberjAxe game
In the game you will throw axes at opponents. It will resemble a multi player side shooter. The main diffrence it will have is the projectile motion. Each player can throw axes from four difrent trajectories. The default will throw in a high arc. If a player holds the fire button, the character will spin the axe around and gain momentum. The longer it is held the closer to a straight trajectory the axe will have. Using the four diffrent trajectories and player position, will be the main skills used.
